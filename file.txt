C supports the use of pointers, a type of reference that records the address or location of an object or function in memory.
Like most procedural languages in the ALGOL tradition, C has facilities for structured programming and allows lexical variable scope and recursion.
Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds.
